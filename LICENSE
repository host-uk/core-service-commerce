Core PHP Framework Template
===========================

Copyright (c) 2026 Host UK / Snider

This project uses a dual-licensing approach:


1. CORE FRAMEWORK CODE (EUPL-1.2)
---------------------------------

The Core PHP Framework packages (host-uk/core, host-uk/core-admin,
host-uk/core-api, host-uk/core-mcp) and any code within the `Core\`
namespace are licensed under the European Union Public Licence v1.2
(EUPL-1.2).

The full EUPL-1.2 license text is available at:
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/eupl-text-eupl-12

And in the Core PHP Framework repository:
https://github.com/host-uk/core-php/blob/main/LICENSE


2. APPLICATION CODE EXCEPTION
-----------------------------

As the copyright holder, we grant the following additional permission:

Code you create within the following directories is EXEMPT from the
EUPL-1.2 copyleft requirements and may be licensed under any terms
you choose (including proprietary licenses):

    app/Mod/          - Your feature modules
    app/Website/      - Your website/domain modules
    app/Service/      - Your service classes
    database/         - Your migrations, seeders, factories
    resources/        - Your views, assets, translations
    routes/           - Your route definitions
    tests/            - Your test files
    config/           - Your configuration files (except config/core.php)

This exception applies ONLY to original code you create in these
directories. It does NOT apply to:

    - Modified copies of Core framework code
    - Code that extends or overrides the `Core\` namespace
    - Derivative works of the Core framework itself


3. CORE NAMESPACE MODIFICATIONS
-------------------------------

If you create local overrides or extensions within the `Core\` namespace
(e.g., in `app/Core/`), those modifications ARE subject to EUPL-1.2 and
its copyleft requirements.

We encourage you to submit such modifications as pull requests to:
https://github.com/host-uk/core-php

This requirement constitutes the consideration for the license grant
herein. The Core PHP Framework is not provided without cost; rather,
the license fee is paid in kind through the contribution of improvements
to the community. By using this software, you acknowledge and agree that
modifications to the Core\ namespace shall be made available to the
community under the same terms, ensuring that all users benefit from
collective improvements. This reciprocal obligation is a fundamental
condition of the license grant and not merely a request.
